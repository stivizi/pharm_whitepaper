# Welcome to The Pharm: A Learning and Play Center for the Autism Community

Nestled on over 26 acres in the picturesque Cordova Bay neighbourhood of Saanich, [The Pharm](index.html#the-pharm) is being transformed into a unique and enriching learning and play center specifically designed for the [autism community](index.html#autism-community). Our mission is to provide a safe, engaging, and supportive environment where children, their families, and the wider community can connect, learn, and grow.

More than just a physical space, The Pharm is envisioned as a healing center for the autism community, offering a place of peace, calm, and opportunity for spiritual and trauma healing. We believe in the power of this land to provide a sanctuary away from the busyness of town, allowing individuals to feel safe and grounded.

## What is The Pharm?

The Pharm is a sprawling farm property that offers a tranquil and stimulating setting. With extensive grounds, including barns, paddocks, and open spaces, it provides ample room for exploration, learning, and play. We are leveraging the natural beauty and existing infrastructure of this former equestrian center to create a haven tailored to the needs of individuals with autism.

## What's in it for the Community and Family?

The Pharm is more than just a center for children; it's a resource for the entire family and the broader community. We aim to foster a supportive network where parents can connect, share experiences, and access resources. The peaceful environment offers a respite for families, providing opportunities for shared activities and relaxation in a setting that understands and accommodates their unique needs. We envision The Pharm as a place that reduces isolation and builds a strong, inclusive community. We also see The Pharm as a multi-generational space, where different age groups can interact and learn from each other, with the potential to bring in the elderly as mentors and connect families looking for a "dopamine detox" from technology with the calming influence of [nature](index.html#nature) and animals.

## What's in it for the Kids?

For children with autism, The Pharm offers a world of discovery and interactive experiences designed to support their development and [well-being](index.html#well-being). The spacious and natural setting provides a calming backdrop for sensory exploration and physical activity. Our programs and activities are being developed with therapeutic goals in mind, promoting social interaction, communication skills, and motor development through engaging and enjoyable experiences. We believe in the potential of every child, including those who are non-verbal, and aim to provide tools and opportunities for them to express themselves and unlock their unique capabilities. The farm is envisioned as a "little town" where kids can experience life, offering a safe environment for self-exploration and growth outside the confines of traditional settings.

## Exploring The Pharm: Interactive Play with Farm Animals

A key highlight of The Pharm will be the opportunity for interactive play with our gentle and friendly farm animals. Children will have supervised opportunities to:

*   **Meet and Greet:** Interact with various farm animals in a calm and controlled environment.
*   **Animal Care Activities:** Participate in simple, supervised tasks like feeding and grooming, promoting responsibility and connection.
*   **Sensory Engagement:** Experience the different textures, sounds, and smells of the farm, providing rich sensory input.
*   **Therapeutic Riding (Future Development):** Explore the potential for equine-assisted activities, leveraging the property's equestrian facilities.

Beyond animal interactions, The Pharm will offer a variety of engaging activities, such as a coloring room, cooking and baking, gardening, exploring the grounds, saunas, cold saunas, massages, art therapy, dirt bike riding, fixing things, a music room, dedicated areas for Lego and sand play, a climbing wall, picking eggs, and feeding goats. These activities are designed to provide diverse opportunities for learning, play, and skill development.

Our interactions with farm animals and participation in all activities will be carefully managed to ensure the safety and comfort of everyone involved, providing valuable learning and therapeutic benefits.

The Pharm represents a unique approach to supporting the autism community, focusing on a natural, engaging, and inclusive environment. We envision this farm as a paradise for the non-verbal and those who love them, a place where everyone feels valued and has the opportunity to thrive. We are exploring various avenues, including a private membership model and innovative funding approaches, to ensure The Pharm remains a sovereign space dedicated to the well-being of its community.

We are excited to open the doors of The Pharm and welcome the autism community to experience the joy and benefits of this special place. Stay tuned for more updates on our programs and opening date!
